In this folder, I am breaking up tutorials into different levels.
The varying levels correspond to my conceptualization to how much knowledge may be needed to gain the most from the material presented.
Some of the higher level posts will cover topics such as finite mixture models, SEM, and handling complex sample data in analyses. 
In level-1, I will lay the foundational knowledge I think has helped me with being able to understand these advanced topics. 

The topics that I plan to discuss (and not in any particular order per se) are

  1. matrix algebra,
  2. simple linear regression,
  3. linear regression with categorical indicators,
  4. connection between t-test and regression, and
  5. conceptualizing measurement error and factor analysis.
