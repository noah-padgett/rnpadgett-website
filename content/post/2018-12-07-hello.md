Hello people (or non-people, I aim to be inclusive)!

My name is Noah, and this is the start of my website and blog! The 
I have finally entered the world of having my own website. 
This feels like so much work so far, and I am happy to finally starting to have my own place to write what I want. 
One of the major reasons I have started this website is to have a place to host my own writings.
The purpose for this is to have a place to store a lot of the R tutorials I have been wanting to write. 
The topics may only be of interest to myself as I work through a project, but maybe one day someone will find these topics of interest.
