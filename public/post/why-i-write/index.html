  <div class="article-container">

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Recently, I have begun writing more and more.
After a beer (or a few more than a beer) I was wondering how I ended up writing so much.
Until I entered my current position as a PhD student I never thought writing would be a major aspect of my work.
By work, I mean that I am researcher.
My training is in educational measurement and advanced statistical methodology.
A lot of what I consider my research is banging my head against a wall to get the darn computer software to quit returning errors during an analysis.
So, the prospect of being a writer didn't occur to me at first.</p>
<p>But, then I realized something important. <em>I want a job.</em></p>
<p>Yes, my motivation for getting my PhD is to get a job.
To get a job, I need to communicate my research effectively enough to get publications.
Describing complex statistical procedures in any form of plain English is anything but simple when first starting.
One of my goals is to be able to write in a simple way for others to understand. 
The issue I find is that writing about structural equation modeling, multilevel modeling, and other complex form of analysis is really easy to be overly complex.
For example, when describing multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (a narely mouthful even to say) is easy to be complex and use sophistocated language that masks my lack of fully understanding the subject matter.
But, this is not useful to anyone.
Especially not for myself.</p>
<p>This brings me to <em>why I write.</em></p>
<p>I write to work on my skills with written English.
I find being able to put words in order a skill that will help me no matter what job I end up doing once I graduate.
Writing, just like any skill, take me time to learn.
The more time I spend, the more I will I get out of the prusuit.</p>
<h3 id="my-difficulties-with-writing">My Difficulties with Writing</h3>
<p>All that information above feels good and all.
But, what I want to work with mostly is being able to explain complex statistical methods in plain language.
In order for me to get to the point where I am more confident in my communication skills I am practicing more.
My major difficulty with writing in the land of advance methods is translating formulas to English.</p>
<p>One of the topics I am actively researching is mixture modeling.
Mixture modeling is a way of classifying cases into like groups based on observed characteristics.
The methods for mixture modeling are extremely varied.
One of the simplest mixture models is a mixture of univariate normal distributions.
That is also a mouthful that doesn't make much sense.</p>
<p>So, to backtrack to explain mixture modeling in the most general sense so that I can bring us back to the &ldquo;simple case&rdquo; of univariate mixtures.
We can think of mixture models as a form of classification.
Classification systems are found all around us.
Libraries are prime examples of classification systems.
I'm a graduate student and I use the library so much.
Yes, most research articles are online, but I am still using books for a lot of my information.
Many of the best introductions to advanced methods are in textbooks now and my library contains many of the seminal texts.
Without some way of organizing the massive number of books within a library I could never find the right books.
Books could be classified in any number of ways.
One way could be author name.
Another could be date published. 
Then one could be by subject matter.
Each of these different methods for classifying books yields a different organization (a different classification system). 
The classification system employed by libraries is analogous to the process that mixture modeling aims to mimic.</p>
<p>Despite mixture modeling being a method of classification, there is amuchmore general aspect to mixture modeling compared to library organizational systems.
In mixture modeling, the classification is unknown at the start.
Based on the observed data, we tried to create the system for classifying people into like groups.
The system may not be the most optimal, but provide a set of rules that can be used to create classes of individuals based on observable characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-developing-skills">Beyond Developing Skills</h2>
<p>Being a skilled communicator takes practice, at least from my experience.
The process of developing skills is by no means an easy path.
This is why I write, to create meaningful opportunities for me to communicate topics that I am interested in. 
In the posts and tutorials to come I will discuss topics such as</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Research collaborations,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working towards being part of a scholarly community,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduction to matrix algebra,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple linear regression through matrix operations, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being stuck with convergence B.S. in mixture modeling.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not sure in what order these different topics will come above. But these will come in time.</p>
