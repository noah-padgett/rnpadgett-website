R does this assignment of values to words or letters through two different mechanisms. You can use “=” or “\u0026lt;-” to make R assign values to objects/letters. However, within R it is customary to only use “\u0026lt;-” for basic assignment while the “=” is reserved for arguments within functions (I will get to this in a moment).\n## Assign the sum of 1 + 1 to x\rx \u0026lt;- 1 + 1\r## Simply place \u0026quot;x\u0026quot; to see the value stored\rx ## [1] 2\rIntro to Simple Functions\rR is a functional programming language, which means that R is designed with tools that take in values to return a result.

The flexibility to choose how we use the simple rules of R provides us with a basis for manipulating data and doing more complex statistical analyses. But, for now I will talk a little bit about how R can be used to generate values randomly.\n\r\rBrief Introduction to Probability\rYes, we are starting with probability. Before we can talk about simulating random data, we need to talk briefly about probability.\nLet’s say we have a quarter. A quarter has two sides, HEADS and TAILS. These two outcomes are possibly if we flip a coin once. A coin is called ‘fair’ if both sides have the same likelihood of occuring. This means that over repeated flips of our coin, we would expect that each outcome (H vs. T) to occur approximately the same number of times. Therefore, if a coin is fair, each outcome H and T will occur 50% of the time. In other words, each outcome has a 0.5 probability of occuring.\nThis is definition note: a probability is strictly between 0 and 1. If a probability if said to be outside this range, then the value cannot be a probability.\nProbability is based on taking a sample from a population. A population is what is often of interest, but we rarely have access to the entire population. The US census is an attempt to get information from the entire US population. Because of cost and time, we take sufficiently large samples from a population to gain insight into the population. For example, to empirically test whether a coin is fair, we need to flip a coin many times generate the number of the times each outcomes occurs. If we flip a coin 1000 times and 500 of these turned out to fair, we likely have good evidence that our coin is fair. In contrast, if we flipped a coin 3 times and all 3 turned out to heads then the question becomes whether or not we ahve enough evidence to conclude that the coin is not fair.\n\rSimulating a Datum\rIn R, we can generate a single sample from a population very easily. Take the example of a coin flip. We can specify a population with two outcomes Heads and Tails with each outcome begin equally likely. From this population, we then take a single draw to obtain a datum.\n\r# Specify the possible outcomes. We do this by telling R to make an object with two values inside. This is done by using the command c(.). Values within the () are stuck together\rpopulation \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#39;HEADS\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;TAILS\u0026#39;)\r# Specify the Probability of each outcome in the population. Each value in the c(.) must align with the corresponding outcome in the population object. outcomeProb \u0026lt;- c(.5, .5)\r# To generate the random draw, we use the following:\r# x = defined population\r# size = number of sample # replace = TRUE/FALSE? Should sampling be done with replacement?\rsample(x=population, size=1, prob = outcomeProb, replace = T)\r## [1] \u0026quot;TAILS\u0026quot;\r\rSimulating Data\rNow, lets simulate more than one datum. We will now simulate 10 coin flips:\n# To do so, we simply adjust the size to 10 instead of 1\rsample(x=population, size=10, prob = outcomeProb, replace = T)\r## [1] \u0026quot;HEADS\u0026quot; \u0026quot;TAILS\u0026quot; \u0026quot;TAILS\u0026quot; \u0026quot;HEADS\u0026quot; \u0026quot;TAILS\u0026quot; \u0026quot;HEADS\u0026quot; \u0026quot;HEADS\u0026quot; \u0026quot;TAILS\u0026quot;\r## [9] \u0026quot;TAILS\u0026quot; \u0026quot;HEADS\u0026quot;\r\r","date":1547604794,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547604794,"objectID":"cd98911c4381d0d523a9e748848cad67","permalink":"/tutorial/2018-12-10-r-simple-sim.rmarkdown/","publishdate":"2019-01-15T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/2018-12-10-r-simple-sim.rmarkdown/","section":"tutorial","summary":"Before we get started with an introduction to simulation, we need to make sure that R and R Studio are downloaded on your computers.

The data come from a data study in the United Kingdom, and I was brought on the project to help with the analysis. For this study, the aim was to investigate the presence of unobserved heterogeneity on the growth trajectories of this construct of \u0026lsquo;alcoholic tendencies.\u0026rsquo; For this analysis, I implemented a Growth Mixture Model (GMM). A GMM is a very complex model that allows for the greatest flexibility in terms of statistical modeling. The aim is to uncover the presence of unobserved groups of people with qualitatively distinct growth patterns. The term growth may be a little misleading as the pattern may be negative or no change may occur. I will not dive into the complexities of the modeling of GMMs in this post. The aim of this post is to show what I have found to be the most useful in terms of reporting GMMs from my readings.\nThe source for these guidelines come from textbooks on GMMs such Grimm, Ram and Estabrook (2017) and the great article van de Schoot et al. (2017).\n Descriptive statistics of observed variables. For dichotomous items, report the proportion of 1’s or proportion of high responses.\n Measurement model, meaning how the four items measured over time relate to the construct of alcoholic tendencies, why a high value on this trait is bad because of a high value on each of these items.\n Measurement invariance – this is where one of the first major limitations, statistical speaking, crops up. Measurement invariance cannot be completely investigated with dichotomous indicators. Below is a brief write-up I started on this topic a few months ago. This should get you started and includes some key references on this topic of measurement invariance with categorical variables. Also, the Grimm et al. (2017) book has some good sections on testing measurement invariance in Mplus (see pgs. 347-350, 381-389).\n Describe the idea of linear growth on this latent trait. Where the growth model aims to describe the growth trajectory of the latent variable across the measurement occasions. We only investigated a linear growth curve. Now another limitation: the latent variable may have a non-linear growth trajectory. A nonlinear growth trajectory could be disguised as the presence of a latent class or this could hide the presence of latent classes do to an improperly specified growth pattern.\n Methods of mixture modeling – idea that more than one latent class underlies these data. This is one of the main points that needs to be described as we are doing a growth mixture model (GMM). The GMM aims to described qualitatively different trajectories in growth on the latent trait over time. This is also where to describe how in our model, we are allowing for class specific intercepts and slopes in the growth model. Meaning that the classes on average have unique average growth trajectories and unique starting points on the latent trait.\n Model selection – along with model summary across class enumerations. We will have estimated the class 1 through class 5 GMMs. We will need to report the log-likelihood, number of parameters, AIC, BIC, ssBIC, LMR-LRT. Along with information on which models had potential convergence issues. Although, hopefully there won’t be much convergence issues once we use more starts…. Anyways, that leads me into a important limitation: estimation of GMM, and mixture models in general, are notorious for being estimated at a local maximum on the likelihood surface and thus we may not have the true optimal solution for this model. We should note how the scale of the latent variable is also arbitrary and therefore the meanstructure was established based on the metric of the observed data and then rescaled to an arbitrary metric for presentation. This will help us to describe which model is best fitting when looking at profile plots:\na. Profile plots will include two types. 1) class average trajectories and 2) class profiles for all individuals by panels of the “raw” factor scores across time. I wrote an R script for you that does this based on two pieces of information the file name and number of classes. This only works for converged models where factor scores were reported.\n Model results to report of final model:\na. Class sizes\nb. Entropy\nc. Plot of the factor scores across time by each class\nd. Class intercepts and slopes with associated standard errors (SE)\ne.

Exposure to cigarette smoke, the primary risk factor in lung cancer, reduces epithelial barrier integrity and increases susceptibility to infections. Herein, we hypothesize that somatic mutations together with cigarette smoke generate a dysbiotic microbiota that is associated with lung carcinogenesis. Using lung tissue from 33 controls and 143 cancer cases, we conduct 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) bacterial gene sequencing, with RNA-sequencing data from lung cancer cases in The Cancer Genome Atlas serving as the validation cohort. Results: Overall, we demonstrate a lower alpha diversity in normal lung as compared to non-tumor adjacent or tumor tissue. In squamous cell carcinoma specifically, a separate group of taxa are identified, in which Acidovorax is enriched in smokers. Acidovorax temporans is identified within tumor sections by fluorescent in situ hybridization and confirmed by two separate 16S rRNA strategies. Further, these taxa, including Acidovorax, exhibit higher abundance among the subset of squamous cell carcinoma cases with TP53 mutations, an association not seen in adenocarcinomas. Conclusions: The results of this comprehensive study show both microbiome-gene and microbiome-exposure interactions in squamous cell carcinoma lung cancer tissue. Specifically, tumors harboring TP53 mutations, which can impair epithelial function, have a unique bacterial consortium that is higher in relative abundance in smoking-associated tumors of this type. Given the significant need for clinical diagnostic tools in lung cancer, this study may provide novel biomarkers for early detection.","tags":null,"title":"Interaction between the microbiome and TP53 in human lung cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Khyam Paneru","R.
