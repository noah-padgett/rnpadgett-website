      <description>I have finally entered the world of having my own website. This feels like so much work so far, and I am happy to finally starting to have my own place to write what I want. One of the major reasons I have started this website is to have a place to host my own writings. The purpose for this is to have a place to store a lot of the R tutorials I have been wanting to write.</description>
