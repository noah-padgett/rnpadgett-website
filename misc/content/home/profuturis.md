Our laboratory resides within the Family and Consumer Sciences Department, which is housed within the Robbins College of Health and Human Sciences. 
We are one of the fastest growing colleges at Baylor University for graduate student degrees. 
As part of our connection to the Departments of Biology and Chemistry, we have access to animal facilities, microscopy core and one of the largest mass spectrometry centers in the state. 
Our lab also maintains two bioinformatic pipelines for the analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing, shotgun sequencing, or RNA-seq on our Cray CS400 Supercomputer. 
Through our collaboration with Drs. Joseph Petrosino and Garth Ehrlich, we have excellent resources to conduct metagenomic sequencing and analysis. 
Other key collaborators include, Drs. James White, Cindy Sears, Anne-Marie Krachler, Rob Britton, Noah Shroyer, Marie Walther-Antonio, Curt Harris, Nick Chia, and Jun Chen. 
We are especially grateful for our clinical collaboration with Dr. Lucas Wong, GI oncologist at Baylor Scott and White Health.
