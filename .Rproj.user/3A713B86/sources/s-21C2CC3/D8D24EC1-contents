## Installing R

Anyways, to install R follow these steps:

1. Go to https://www.r-project.org/
2. Click on 'to download R'
3. Choose a 'CRAN mirror', a CRAN mirror is where your computer knows to look on the internet to download the software. I suggest https://cran.revolutionanalytics.com/ which is based out of Dallas. 
4. Select the download that is approriate for your computer.
5. Then scroll down to the download: R-3.5.1.pkg (mac) or install for the first time (windows).

These steps will help you install R, next we need to download R Studio.

## Installing R Studio

R Studio is an interface to use R that is much more friendly and easier to work with. 
You will see this when you open both.

1. Go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
2. Scroll down to 'Installers for Supported Platforms' 
3. Select either the windows or mac version

Now that we have R and R studio downloaed, let's dive into an Intro to Simulation.

===

## Intro to the World of R

- R is a statistical programming language.
- The initial struggle is *OKAY*.
- I am constantly googling how to solve errors and complete my tasks. 

===

## R is a fancy Calculator

We want to find the sum of "1 + 1". 
R will automatically return the result of 2.

```{r}
1 + 1
```

===

## Variable Assignment

```{r}
## Assign the sum of 1 + 1 to x
x <- 1 + 1
## Simply place "x" to see the value stored
x 
```

## Intro to Simple Functions

- One of the simplest functions in R is the "print()" function.

```{r}
## Store "Hello People" in y
y <- "Hello People"
## Displaythe value of y
print(x=y) ## x is theargument of print, and we want to print y
```
 
This concept of storing values into objects to use in functions is **extremely** important.
